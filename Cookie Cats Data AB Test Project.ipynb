    "# Cookie Cats Data A/B Test Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "This Cookie_cats data is obtained from Kaggle. Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic \"connect three\" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. It also features singing cats. We're not kidding! As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Cookie_cats data set has 90189 rows and 5 columns. The columns include userid, version, sum_gamerounds, retention_1, retention_7. “userid” is a unique number that identifies each player. “version” is  whether the player was put in the control group (gate_30 - a gate at level 30) or the test group with the moved gate (gate_40 - a gate at level 40). “sum_gamerounds” means the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after install. “retention_1” means whether the players come back and play 1 day after installing the app or not. “retention_7” means whether the players come back and play 7 days after installing the app or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will conduct A/B test and assume gate_40 will have more player retention. Then the null hypothesis is proposed as no difference between gate_30 and gate_40 for player retention. Further, we will compute the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after installing the app for these two groups: gate_30 and gate_40. Also, significant difference or not on the number of game rounds played (sum_gamerounds) between these two groups will be investigated as a secondary metric.  A t-test, z-test and p-value of 0.05 are used in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two stages are designed for this A/B test. First, a rollout plan is to investigate player retention after one day playing. Becuase this data set already provided two group sizes (almost same size half-half 50:50, about 45000), let's use these sample sizes for A/B test. Next, it is about investigating 7-day retention: there is any difference between these two groups? \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, this project task will have: \n",
    "   * The distribution of game rounds\n",
    "   * Overall 1-day retention\n",
    "   * 1-day retention by AB-group\n",
    "   * Should we be confident in the difference\n",
    "   * Zooming in on the difference\n",
    "   * The probability of a difference\n",
    "   * 7-day retention by AB-group\n",
    "   * Bootstrapping the difference again\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's start to take a look data."

This confirms that z-test is more reliable for propotion samples.But the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after install seems no significant difference between two groups. So, it might be worth working with the advertising and engineering teams to see if you could figure out the reasons for it. For example, it can decrease waiting time to progress or make an in-app purchase and so on."
